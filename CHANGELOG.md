## [1.0.3] - [17/07/25]
### Added Simple UILineRenderer
* Added new UILineRenderer MaskableGraphic. At the moment this is a simple UI implementation of something like Unity's LineRenderer. Some basic optimisation in there, but will probably revisit to improve further.

## [1.0.2] - [11/07/25]
### More Housekeeping
* Organised more utilities into their own utilities scripts
* Subdivided the extensions.cs script into categorised extensions scripts
* Ensured that extensions scripts handle as little logic as possible, passed to utilities scripts
