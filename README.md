# BeltainsTools
This is a simple Unity package that includes a collection of generalised tools for quicker and more enjoyable game development using the Unity engine. This has been and will be updated continuously as and when I find myself wanting to do something in engine that isn't as simple as I'd wish.

Here's a rundown of the high level features of the package:
* <b>Pooling</b> - An easy to use and powerful event-based pooling system.
* <b>Helpful Utilities/Extensions</b> - Contains many helpful extension and utility methods for some commonly used Unity classes and structs, from Vectors and Floats to the Camera, Physics and Animations.
* <b>BEvents</b> - An alternative to C# events with easier tracking of subscribers, and some other wrapper functions.
* <b>Debugging Tools</b> - A powerful debugging overlay that allows for executing commands as well as telemetry readouts.
* <b>Coroutine Yield Instructions</b> - Some useful yield instructions to improve coroutine readability and implementation.

* <b>Math Library</b> - Additional maths functions located in the MathB class as well as support for other specific maths bits like Beziers.
